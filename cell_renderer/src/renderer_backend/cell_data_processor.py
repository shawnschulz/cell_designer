# 1. Need to check if need to do scanpy's highly variable gene calculation and do it if so
# (Later) Should use preexisting cell type annotations, and/or infer cell type annotation
# 2. Need to annotate whether the top most highly variable genes are surface receptors
# 3. Need to get the top 10 most highly variable surface receptors
# 4. Need to calculate relative % level of transcription among the most highly variable surface receptors
# 5. Need to output that information, probably just in csv for now but eventually add it to a sql DB
# (note) I think it makes more sense to calculate the color mapping in the renderer rather than do it here, but the cmap should be added to the DB

# Might want to create a new cell_info class? For now can just treat it as a pandas dataframe until we run into limits with 
# that
