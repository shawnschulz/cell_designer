# TODOs

1. Test linalg.cpp via webassembly
- Work out how to set up header files source etc.
- Make a main program that simply inverts a mat4
- Check that inverts the mat4 properly
2. Hook up to webgl
- Look at WASM webgl tutorial
- Supply webgl with proper camera view projection
- You will probably have to rewrite the obj loader to use C++
