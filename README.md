# Cell Designer

# TODO
1. Basic backend using C++ and websockets
2. User uploads h5ad or single row of gene expression data + cell_name, can run inference on what cell type and get top 10 TF and cell surface receptors (or just finds if any of the most variable genes are the same
3. Server performs inference, finds top genes, and then produces a 3d model for the single cell
4. Front ends recieves the data for this and renders it for the user
5. If have time, try to 3d model interactions between cells
6. If have even more additional time, try to allow user to actually edit the 3d modeled interactions
